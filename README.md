# CodeCraft-2019 

This program is used in the preliminary contest of Huawei Software Challenge Competition in 2019.
The program includes two maps of 10,000 trained cars and 60,000 final race cars, which are stored in "*_cars/CodeCraft-2019/config/" respectively.

This program will give the right route for the vehicles, save it in '*_cars/CodeCraft-2019/config/answer.txt', evaluate the driving plan through '*_cars/CodeCraft-2019/config/simulator.py', and save the road map in the '*_cars/CodeCraft-2019/config/simulatePictures folder'.
